# MS-fingering-diagram
Port of the MuseScore v3 Fingering diagram https://musescore.org/en/project/fingering-diagram to MuseScore >=v4.4

Changed font (set Advance width to 1 instead 0) to make it usable in MuseScore 4x and 3.7 Evolution 

**It seems this does not work on Windows. It does work on Linux**

# Changes

20250916: Modified font and plugin for use with trumpet, euphonium, tombone and french horn.( amateur range; professionals do not need a fingering diagram)
